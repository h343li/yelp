0,Secret Pizza,"The pizza was okay. Not the best I've had. I prefer Biaggio's on Flamingo / Fort Apache. The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza. The pizzeria @ Cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food.

3,Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant,"Back in 2005-2007 this place was my FAVORITE thai place EVER. I'd go here ALLLLL the time. I never had any complaints. Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a ""Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?"" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money.

6,Thai Original BBQ Restaurant,"If you like Thai food, you have to try the original thai bbq. Their pad se ew is to DIE for. Their thai egg rolls are delicious. Basil beef will not let you down (its not on the menu anymore, you have to ask for it!) 

Yes, the building is not as fancy as some other places. Yes, i've batted a fly off my plate more than once. Yes, I do NOT go to the bathroom their because I dont even WANT to know what it looks like... 

BUT.. the thai food is the best in town. The service rocks. And you can get a $25 gift cert. on Restaurant.com for $2. Can you beat that? I think NOT.

7,KoMex Fusion,"AMAZING!!!

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought ""Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know""... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!","['amazing!!!', 'i was referred here by a friend and at first thought ""korean and mexican??', 'weird... i dont know""... but my husband and i were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place.', 'lol  all in all, food was delicious, a lot of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor.', 'hell even my burps taste delicious.', 'bahaha!']",17,1214

9,Beach Cafe,"Food is pretty good, not gonna lie. BUT you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there. It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! 

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. 

End Rant. 

PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area.

Katsu don was super delicious and fresh. I was starving, finished mine and then went into a food coma.

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

The Marketplace was...well, we thought it was like a hospital cafeteria with a lot less staff and a giant mess. Popcorn all over the floors and counters, condiments spilled, condiment droppings on the counter. Saw 2 girls with brooms - not cleaning but chatting it up with the cashier.

Gotta line up 3 times, one to order, another to pay, and another to pick up your order. Pure confusion for a 1st timer. So you go back, front, and back. Liked the soda machine cause you pick and mix. The 'bar?' It looks like  and afterthought with I think 5 stools.

The bathroom. GROSS. 4 stalls not completely flushed and 1 with wet droppings on the floor. 2 sinks without soap and the used papertowels were overflowing. The automatic machine was rolling the new ones into the used ones. Did I mention there was red/brown debris on the stainless steel?

We searched Yelp and found him with all good reviews which made us decide to go to him for these very important pictures. The results are very disappointing! 

Jon seems to be a friendly person, except that in the beginning he tried to deny a Yelp deal that we purchased, as he claimed the deal is for family photos only, which was NOT said in the deal description when we purchased. Anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually. However, it turned out to be a terrible experience.  

First of all, his studio is in his house, or maybe more specifically, in his garage. Certainly it is not fun to take a one-hour-photo-shoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited air-conditioning in the garage. He had to use a fan trying to make it cooler. But most importantly, his technique is not very impressive at all.  My green dress turned out to be blue in my photos! The skin tone of my face in the pictures turned out to be uneven, despite the fact I was put on make-up by professional beauty artist. Also, his so-called touch-ups of the pictures are awful, that he didn't even try to take the shines on my face away! --- As a matter of fact, I don't think those pictures we purchased have been touched up at all!  

I am not sure if he is good at taking family pictures as other claimed in the reviews, but if you go for professional head-shots, I won't recommend him at all.

We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.

The food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?!

109,earth Bloor West,"It might be a bit unfair to review Globe so early into their existence, but I don't feel too badly about it. Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.

Globe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.

I suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.

The main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.

The dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.

Despite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.

Truth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.","[""it might be a bit unfair to review globe so early into their existence, but i don't feel too badly about it."", ""reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening."", ""globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant."", ""truth be told, globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion."", 'however despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside.', ""i think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in bloor west village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with globe.""]",31,22
110,Origin,"I have been itching to get to Origin for months now after a friend of mine had gone and raved about the food. I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.

It was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.

Next up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.

Those scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.

Our next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.

Next up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.

Our final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.

Next up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!

Finally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.","['i have been itching to get to origin for months now after a friend of mine had gone and raved about the food.', 'i dug the concept: tapas with a twist.', 'this is definitely not your traditional, spanish tapas.', ""i have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this."", 'go with friends, go on a date, go with family.', ""it's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.""]",50,193
111,Souz Dal,"Alright, alright, so as it turns out I sometimes judge a book by its cover. Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.

It was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.

The stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.

Now I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the ""best"" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. 

Now I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. 

Unlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. 

Although funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.","['alright, alright, so as it turns out i sometimes judge a book by its cover.', ""or, in this case, a bar by its' signage."", ""let's face it, i'm a sucker for good signage."", ""although funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare iwon't be returning to souz dal."", 'if however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over.', 'and if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on mondays.']",32,35
112,Mazz Sushi,"Away from the hubbub of the Annex and Little Korea, sushi joints become fewer and further between. On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.

An unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.

On a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.

Seated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.

Upon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.

After a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.

Before these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.

Just as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.

Next, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.

Overall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.","['away from the hubbub of the annex and little korea, sushi joints become fewer and further between.', 'on a relatively quiet stretch of bloor west, between dovercourt and dufferin, sits mazz sushi.', 'an unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, mazz sushi has been one of the few sushi options for bloorcourt and bloordale residents.', 'not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant.', ""the food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long."", 'and although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.']",33,57
113,Grenadier Cafe,"If you've ever driven by High Park on Bloor street, seen the street-level sign that advertises 3 dollar breakfast, and considered stopping in to check it out, you're probably lucky you didn't. Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.

All of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star.

114,Uncle Betty's Diner,"Uncle Betty's is a family foodie heaven: the sole Toronto provider of New York's famous Dreesen's doughnuts, a colourful ice cream and dessert bar, warm and fuzzy comfort food, and a small selection of beer and wine for the grown-ups in the crowd, all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike. Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.

Offering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the ""best ever,"" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. 

For dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.

The service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the ""gourmet"" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. 

Most appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. 

Betty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.

115,The Ace,"I am the first to admit that I don't know Roncesvalles Village well. A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.

We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a ""Christmas burger"" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. 

Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. 

If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. 
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!

By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.","[""i am the first to admit that i don't know roncesvalles village well."", 'a friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer.', 'in recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining roncesvalles ave has drawn me to the west side of the city more frequently.', 'i would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.', 'go early or go late or go for brunch.', ""you won't be disappointed.""]",34,149
116,KINKA IZAKAYA BLOOR,"Can I get a Whopper? Not anymore...

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.","['can i get a whopper?', 'not anymore...  a former burger king at bathurst and bloor has become the second toronto location for the vancouver dynamo chain.', ""it's easy enough to almost walk past guu sakabar--nicknamed guu 2--as you travel down bloor street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows."", 'quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for.', 'it was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and i did feel as though we were part of it.', ""you may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.""]",31,403
117,Lou Dawg's Southern BBQ,"Food, like fashion, has a lot to do with trends. Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.

A number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.
Lately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.

On a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.

With our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...

The pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.

Side dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.

The small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.

Overall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.","['food, like fashion, has a lot to do with trends.', 'every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere.', 'someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.', 'or just a hangout for friends of the staff?', 'this indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place.', ""so while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.""]",42,100
118,The Mugshot Tavern,"The High Park neighbourhood is near-void of good places to grab a pint. Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.

If the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.

The food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.

They've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.

And the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.

It's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.

The Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.","['the high park neighbourhood is near-void of good places to grab a pint.', 'well, it was until the mugshot tavern opened anyways... the mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some.', ""truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be."", ""customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em."", ""the mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space."", 'in a neighbourhood like high park, the mugshot tavern is unrivaled in every respect.']",33,78
119,The Westerly,"Located at the top of the restaurant strip on Roncesvalles, The Westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.  The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.

We spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.

After a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.

When the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.

Between the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.

Amazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.

I would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!","['located at the top of the restaurant strip on roncesvalles, the westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.', ""the uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'."", 'five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.', 'i would return to the westerly, unquestionably.', 'my friends and i had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).', ""if you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!""]",29,80
120,Five Doors North,"5 Doors North is my neighbourhood spot. I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, ""Thursday night out"" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.","['5 doors north is my neighbourhood spot.', 'i have visited it on several occasions, and each time i leave, i debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush.', 'my conscience prevails, as 5 doors north is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow tofoodreviews readers.', 'the prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range.', 'the service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in.', ""it's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 doors north as much as you will.""]",28,105
121,Bamburger,"Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive ""gourmet burger"" trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.

While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed ""diner"" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.

Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.

The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is ""Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),"" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!

We went with the ""Bambamburger ($11.50),"" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the ""Bambamburger,"" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.

Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.

If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.","['bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive ""gourmet burger"" trend taking over yonge street, including gourmet burger co., south street burger co., burger shoppe and gourmet burger.', 'while bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at yonge and davisville.', 'bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths.', 'bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it.', 'the service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.', 'if you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, bamburger will deliver.']",22,31

123,Mr Greek Mediterranean Grill,"I know some people are going to completely disagree with my 1 star rating here, and to be honest, 10 years ago I would have thought the same; but considering how much the culture of Greek food on the Danforth has evolved in the past 10 years, Mr Greek seems to have been left far, far behind.

Mr Greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria. That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.

I remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.

I actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.

On a street with as many options as the Danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!) to end up in this joint.","['i know some people are going to completely disagree with my 1 star rating here, and to be honest, 10 years ago i would have thought the same; but considering how much the culture of greek food on the danforth has evolved in the past 10 years, mr greek seems to have been left far, far behind.', 'mr greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria.', ""that might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because i've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible."", ""i remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent."", 'the souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what greek food is in toronto.', 'although i appreciated his effort, the last thing i want is to be forced another meal there.', ""i know restaurants can have a bad day, and i'm willing to overlook that."", ""but from what i saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past."", ""on a street with as many options as the danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!)"", 'to end up in this joint.']",12,20

While I defintely have had better pizza before, for something quick, fairly inexpensive and reasonably tasty, there isn't much within walking distance that beats it. Just stay away at noon during the week, or the highschool crowd will eat you alive.

125,India Palace,"Having a craving for something spiced and exotic and motivated by a friend's comments that, ""there is a good Indian place over on Queen,"" I ventured out in hopes of finding something deliciously curried. Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?

One thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.

It is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.

The menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrée, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrée-and it came in at under $5.

For the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.

One of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.

Overall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.","['having a craving for something spiced and exotic and motivated by a friend\'s comments that, ""there is a good indian place over on queen,"" i ventured out in hopes of finding something deliciously curried.', 'upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on queen west where a string of three of four indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?', ""one thing i love about toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building."", 'this is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, i say go for it!', ""buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with."", ""overall, i can't leave you saying it was the very best indian cuisine i've ever had, but i can say that i wasn't disappointed, and i would go back again-especially for that buffet.""]",23,38
126,Pancho's Bakery,"I heart churros.  At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all ""I heart"" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.

Pancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.

It was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.

Full of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.

The churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.

We started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.

Later at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of café con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.

The bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.

127,&Company Resto Bar,"We were invited last week to attend a new menu tasting event at &Company Resto Bar in Mississauga (across from Square One Shopping Center).

First impressions were that this restaurant is HUGE. It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.

The menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.

First, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.

Next up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!

Traditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.

Unfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.

Under recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.

Once 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.

Overall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.","['we were invited last week to attend a new menu tasting event at &company resto bar in mississauga (across from square one shopping center).', 'first impressions were that this restaurant is huge.', ""it's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner."", 'overall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on king street in toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table.', 'the service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant.', '&company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.']",42,44
128,Joy Bistro,"Joy Bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside Leslieville on Toronto's East side. It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.

First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.

Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.

That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.

They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?

Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.","[""joy bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside leslieville on toronto's east side."", ""it's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage."", ""it's become somewhat of a leslieville landmark."", ""despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch."", 'so the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to joy bistro for brunch on the patio.', ""by the sounds of it though, i certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.""]",23,129
129,Terroni,"So lately I've been on a bit of an Italian kick. Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.
 
The camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. 

While (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). 

As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  
  
Regardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. 

Our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  

We started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. 
 
We chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.
 
No sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. 

Now when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...","[""so lately i've been on a bit of an italian kick."", ""maybe its the changing of the seasons, and i'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation."", 'whatever it is, this past monday i was looking for just that at terroni on queen west.', ""maybe i'm just speaking for myself here, but i have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at terroni."", ""i'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at terroni is so thin and pliable i always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it."", 'once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...']",30,303
130,Momofuku Daishō,"Torontonians have welcomed Momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs. Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.

Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...

Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.

With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.

As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.

First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!

Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!

We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudité; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.

And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.

Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,

We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.

All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?","['torontonians have welcomed momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs.', 'last month, david chang, founder of momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: the tiff food on film series.', 'he joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, ang lee\'s ""eat drink man woman"", and then engaged the audience in an informal q&a session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.', 'all in all, we were blissfully overfed at momofuku daisho.', 'it was lovely dining with david chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic.', 'good friends and good food - what could be better?']",22,238
131,Globe Bistro,"Much like Ed Ho's recent earth Bloor West endeavour, Globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, I find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is.

Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.

With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.

Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...
There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.

The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.

The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.

Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.
It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.

Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.","[""much like ed ho's recent earth bloor west endeavour, globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, i find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is."", ""cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space."", ""it draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special."", 'from the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, i was sure i was in for something special.', ""perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients."", ""great cooking is all about balance, and if globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.""]",23,115
132,O.Noir,"For those that don't know, O.Noir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark. Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.

Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.

First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.

I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.

Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.

The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.

Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.

Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.

On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.

O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...","[""for those that don't know, o.noir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark."", 'yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust.', ""you can't see a dam thing down there in o.noir's dark and dingy basement dining room."", 'o.noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that.', 'the pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway.', 'i was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...']",44,291
133,Axis Gastropub,"Having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide, it doesn't take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat. This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.

Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.

Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.

Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.

Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.

Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.

At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.

Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.","[""having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide, it doesn't take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat."", 'this was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at axis gastropub on the corner of bloor and markham in mirvish village.', ""axis sits in the old rocco's plum tomato location and is the sister pub to axis gallery and grill in the junction."", 'overall, axis gastropub does not live up to its name.', ""it doesn't really feel like a pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food."", ""maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but i can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.""]",23,8
134,Mascot,"Sometimes I ride the 501 streetcar just for something to do.  It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.

At first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.

My girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  

As it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.

The quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. 

Food however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.

135,Utopia Café & Grill,"Utopia Cafe and Grill is aptly named. Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.

It was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.

Needless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!

And if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.

I started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.

Between the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.

On a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.

If Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.

For a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).

Utopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.","['utopia cafe and grill is aptly named.', 'let me tell you why... one hot and muggy saturday evening, i found myself walking down college street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst.', ""now, i'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and college street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants."", ""they also have a four season patio (another good reason i don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, i have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside)."", ""utopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool."", 'as its name implies, this bohemian spot in little italy is truly ideal.']",46,232
136,Nota Bene,"Beautifully modern and discerning, Nota Bene provides the perfect setting for special occasions and casual dining alike. What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.

You might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.

We started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved ""Chef David's"" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.

For appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeño ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeños offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.

Next we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.

For our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purée, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.

We also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso añejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso añejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.

With dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.

For dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.

Go try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.

137,Megas Restaurant,"Geez. I just cant figure it out. I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.

The big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. 

Once you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.

The inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.

Unfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.

I'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.","['geez.', 'i just cant figure it out.', ""i've been looking through what other people have said about megas, and it's all so bad...really bad."", ""i mean, they've got a few things going for them."", ""like i said, the first time was pretty good, and if i knew i was guaranteed that every time, i'd have no problems returning."", ""megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.""]",36,45
138,Say Cheese,"Once upon a time I was a university student.  Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. 

I haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.

It was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  

I started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.

Next, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  

As if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;

 Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. 

 Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.

The French Grilled Toast is like a ménage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.

So in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  

Footnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.","['once upon a time i was a university student.', ""without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, i will tell you that gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and mambo #5 was tearing up the charts."", 'so thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.', 'now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that.', 'this bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.', 'footnote:  during the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.']",43,37
139,Littlefish,"As I'm writing this, I already know a lot of people are going to disagree with me. After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.

The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.

People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.

Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.

So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.","[""as i'm writing this, i already know a lot of people are going to disagree with me."", 'after all, the arrival of littlefish in the junction has definitely been well received.', 'the neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot.', ""i'd like to give them another chance."", 'i think the whole neighbourhood would.', 'after all, the junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the junction.']",39,66
140,Lil' Baci,"I'm a sucker for top-notch pizza. By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.

Lil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.

When I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.

Lil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.

And the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.

Lil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.

Lil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.

The dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.

I head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!","[""i'm a sucker for top-notch pizza."", 'by top-notch, i mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients.', 'pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that i could eat every day.', 'the custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.', ""i head to lil' baci when i want some decently priced italian food and some amazing pizza."", 'lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!']",35,127
141,Aunties & Uncles,"I was here the other day for lunch and, as expected, there was a bit of a line.  That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. 

When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  

First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.

Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.

Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area.","['i was here the other day for lunch and, as expected, there was a bit of a line.', ""that's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true."", ""but waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood."", ""if you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, i'd suggest you head over to manic."", 'aunties and uncles loses points in service.', ""the service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the college & bathurst area.""]",18,332
142,La Hacienda Restaurant,"Meh. You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.

I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. 

La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.

But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. 

Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.

On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.

Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.","['meh.', ""you'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in la hacienda's case."", ""not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned."", 'there is absolutely nothing special, or mexican for that matter, about it at all.', ""it's just greasy, over-priced, 'mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on queen west."", ""if you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.""]",25,51
143,Murrays Sandwich Emporium,"The story goes, according to the Murray's Sandwich Emporium website, that Murray is a weiner dog who loves the finer things in life. Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.

I recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most cliché lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. 

There is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). 

The restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.

I held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. 

Truthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly sautéed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!

I felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.

Overall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent.

144,Grindhouse Burger Bar,"I am in love...

How do I know? I paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.

Grindhouse is serious carnivore territory.

The first thing to stand out, though, was my drink. I went for my usual diet cola and I got, ""Sorry we don't have anything with aspartame."" In fact, you shouldn't go there expecting to get your go-to big brand soft drink at all. Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then. Boylan's Birch Beer - a root beer drink, sweetened with cane sugar, with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative (sodium benzoate, typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves). Their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end there.

All of the ingredients are local and fresh, the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is Genetically Modified Organism, hormone and antibiotic-free. You will not find anything that has refined sugars, or artificial sweeteners (hence the lack of Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the premises). They literally prepare everything in-house. The buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves, right in the back kitchen. The ""fresh and never frozen"" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.

Their burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).

If you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.

I actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.

Much like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a ""perfect"" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.

Their name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.","['i am in love...  how do i know?', 'i paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.', 'grindhouse is serious carnivore territory.', 'lovely.', 'much like my university professors, i hesitate to give out a ""perfect"" score and i can\'t on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.', ""their name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.""]",26,47
145,Aux Delices Cafe de Bayview,"If you are on your way to go shopping at Bayview Village, and you need to stop for a quick bite, look no further than Aux Delices Café.

Situated at the main entrance of Bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy Saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals. Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.

We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.

The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.

Next up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.

For those looking for the ""café"" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.

Aux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.
Gourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.","['if you are on your way to go shopping at bayview village, and you need to stop for a quick bite, look no further than aux delices café.', 'situated at the main entrance of bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals.', 'being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, aux delices caters to their clientele.', 'aux delices café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry.', 'all of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.', 'gourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.']",26,9
146,Prairie Girl Bakery,"Cupcakes have reached a point of utmost popularity in the world of baked goods. Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!

Walking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.

When I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, ""was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?"" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a ""day-old cupcake."" So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.

The cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.

A dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.

Want to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or ""trans"" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.

On one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.","['cupcakes have reached a point of utmost popularity in the world of baked goods.', 'why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts?', ""well, i'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of prairie girl bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!"", ""the story is that prairie girl bakery's creator, jean blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her saskatchewan farm."", 'she eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers.', ""i don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what prairie girl bakery is and what they produce.""]",36,123
147,Coquine Restaurant,"Coquine Restaurant serves up an excellent weekend brunch, with all the charm and flavour of a European patio café. The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .

Traditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.

Everyone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chévre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.

Overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.","['coquine restaurant serves up an excellent weekend brunch, with all the charm and flavour of a european patio café.', 'the restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls.', 'coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal.', 'overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing.', 'both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious.', 'with an excellent location between davisville and eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.']",17,128
148,Nuthouse,"If the word 'bulk' conjers up images of dusty old ethnic shop food bins or soulless Bulk Barns, then you need to check out Nuthouse for a second opinion. Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.

First thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.

Ok. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.

Nuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.

Personally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. 

Wanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.","[""if the word 'bulk' conjers up images of dusty old ethnic shop food bins or soulless bulk barns, then you need to check out nuthouse for a second opinion."", 'sitting in a little space out in the bloor and lansdowne, nuthouse has established itself with blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.', ""first thing you'll notice about nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee."", 'and that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something.', ""buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less."", 'the fact that nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.']",25,16
149,Famoso Neapolitan,"Walk in to Famoso's new Annex location and there is no mistaking the kind of restaurant you have entered: a popular, loud hang out for students, families and friends alike. It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.

Once seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the ""red sauce"" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The ""white sauce""pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)

We opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.

Our appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.

Our funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)

Our second pizza - the San Andreas - was a ""New World Pizza"" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.

Finally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.

Overall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences.

150,Passione Italiana Ristorante,"La Passione is a dimly lit and intimately decorated restaurant on Yonge, just south of St. Clair, where you can get your fill of any and all your Italian favourites and a (huge) glass of wine.
Their extensive menu holds everything from Calamari Fritti, Insalata Arugula, Papparedelle al Salmone and Penna alla Vodka to Gnocchi with a choice of four sauces, Pollo alla Jolly (chicken in rose sauce) and Margherita pizza (a simple delight of mozzarella, olive oil and oregano).

La Passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts; you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their Facebook page, then go and grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and, as I found out while waiting for my dinner guests who were running late, it is a very comfortable space to sit and relax with a glass of red.

From start to finish, it was delightful. For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.

I was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken sautéed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.

The veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of sautéed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.
And as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.

Personally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.

La Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.","['la passione is a dimly lit and intimately decorated restaurant on yonge, just south of st. clair, where you can get your fill of any and all your italian favourites and a (huge) glass of wine.', 'their extensive menu holds everything from calamari fritti, insalata arugula, papparedelle al salmone and penna alla vodka to gnocchi with a choice of four sauces, pollo alla jolly (chicken in rose sauce) and margherita pizza (a simple delight of mozzarella, olive oil and oregano).', 'la passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts; you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their facebook page, then go and grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta.', ""i also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence."", 'la passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy.', 'they also occasionally post deals on groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.']",17,20
151,La Rev,"La Revolucion is amazing! Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.

La Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.

They're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.

Presentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.

Interestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is.

152,Liberty Village Rotisserie Grill,"The Rotisserie House is a family-run, Portuguese barbeque (or Churrasqueira) restaurant in the Liberty Village area. Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of décor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.

They happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.

They offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1/4 or 1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.

The menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.

I decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their ""famous"" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.

One of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.

I do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!

Considering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.

If I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.","['the rotisserie house is a family-run, portuguese barbeque (or churrasqueira) restaurant in the liberty village area.', 'like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of décor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.', 'they happen to be closed on the weekend, but from monday to thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. the hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.  they offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option.', 'however, they seem to have it all figured out.', 'if i lived closer to liberty village, i could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work.', ""the prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.""]",26,41
153,Dark Horse,"The most common praise of Dark Horse is its patio; the most common complaint about Dark Horse is its lack of service on the patio...

If you've been to Bloor West Village, you know that there aren't a lot of patios in the neighbourhood, and any patio that you do find is likely going to be small, cramped, and full of people. With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.

But, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...

All-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.

All of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.

Dark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.

Truth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.","[""the most common praise of dark horse is its patio; the most common complaint about dark horse is its lack of service on the patio...  if you've been to bloor west village, you know that there aren't a lot of patios in the neighbourhood, and any patio that you do find is likely going to be small, cramped, and full of people."", 'with the exception of the firkin on runnymede, dark horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.', ""but, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there."", 'another server or two during their busier times, and dark horse could be fantastic.', ""truth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that."", ""if you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, dark horse provides nicely.""]",16,39
154,The Central,"Located in the Annex, in the middle of Mirvish Village, The Central is a bar, a restaurant, and a live music venue.  The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the ""Draught: Use Your Eyes"" sign behind the bar.

But, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.

The menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.

While the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.

I have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.

I give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.","['located in the annex, in the middle of mirvish village, the central is a bar, a restaurant, and a live music venue.', 'the dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.', 'i loved the rickety setting and little details like the ""draught: use your eyes"" sign behind the bar.', 'also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.', 'when we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called netherworld, a flying monkey brew, which is similar to the popular mill st. tankhouse ale.', 'i give them an a+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.']",22,43
155,Everest Cafe & Bar,"Wanting to try something new, and looking for a cool place to go for pre-Yuk-Yuks dinner and drinks, my friend and I decided to try out Everest Restaurant on Queen West.

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy ""club"" like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.

I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new ""go-to"" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!
Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.

The dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their ""specialty cuisine"" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.

After some quality deliberation between the Tibet/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try ""Little Tibet"" further down Queen Street.","['wanting to try something new, and looking for a cool place to go for pre-yuk-yuks dinner and drinks, my friend and i decided to try out everest restaurant on queen west.', 'what seemed to be a quiet saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy ""club"" like dining experience.', 'and everest is certainly dressed to impress.', 'the butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving indian food.', 'while i thoroughly enjoyed everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, i was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into tibetan food.', 'i think the next time we decide to go out for tibetan style cuisine, we will try ""little tibet"" further down queen street.']",25,45
156,Holy Oak,"Despite it's seemingly religious name, this Blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion. It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.

There really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.

The menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.

I've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.

I went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.

Holy Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that.","[""despite it's seemingly religious name, this blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion."", ""it's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe."", ""you know the type of place i'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, value village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling."", ""holy cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it."", ""if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up wifi and get a decent cup of coffee, holy oak can definitely provide."", ""but it doesn't offer much more than that.""]",28,53
157,The Kennedy Public House,"Sharkey's is no more! And thank God for that. I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.

So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...

A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.

The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.

The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.
Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.

One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.

Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.","[""sharkey's is no more!"", 'and thank god for that.', 'i mean, i know the restaurant options in bloor west village are limited, but i really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did.', ""hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter."", ""keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place."", ""with strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at john and adelaide, the kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.""]",27,107
158,The Rebel House,"As a group of new Toronto recruits, we decided to try out Rebel House at the suggestion of one of my coworkers. An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.

The Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.

The menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.

My dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.

My dining partner, an ""adventurous"" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.

Our server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.","['as a group of new toronto recruits, we decided to try out rebel house at the suggestion of one of my coworkers.', 'an easy walk from the rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the stanley cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.', 'the rebel house is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat.', 'our server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at rebel house are fairly reasonable.', 'wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée.', 'except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, rebel house is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.']",22,102
159,Ultimate Cafe,"I came to Ultimate Café by accident. In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Café (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. 

Their menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.

After my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.

I've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.

Then, I went back for lunch. 

We started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrée was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person

There is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. 

So, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. 

Just doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.","['i came to ultimate café by accident.', 'in a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of hey lucy, i was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini wednesday at that popular king west spot.', 'enter stage-right, ultimate café (a bit of entertainment district fun for you there).', 'the decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night.', 'they offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich.', 'just doors down from the previously reviewed joe mamas, king west is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.']",31,24
160,Duke of Kent,"The Duke of Kent serves up traditional pub food in a cozy spot at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton.  Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.

After a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.

I snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!

As for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.

As I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.

For a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!

At the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.","['the duke of kent serves up traditional pub food in a cozy spot at the corner of yonge and eglinton.', ""kent is just one of a series of 'duke pubs' scattered around toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that english corner pub ambience."", 'after a long week at work, i was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the duke of kent was a great choice...for the most part.', ""also, i have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!"", 'at the end of it all, the duke of kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!', 'my food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.']",23,89
161,Banjara Indian Cuisine,"As soon as you step inside, your first thought will likely be that there is no possible way this place was built to be an Indian restaurant. The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.

Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.

Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.

Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.

I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me.

162,Bar Salumi,"Bar Salumi is the unassuming sister bar-come-restaurant to The Local Kitchen in Parkdale.  It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.

My friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.

Two weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.

As it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.

There is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.

The menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives & nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.

Our pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.

I wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.","['bar salumi is the unassuming sister bar-come-restaurant to the local kitchen in parkdale.', ""it might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when i mentioned its name...but maybe bar salumi doesn't like the spotlight."", ""indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront."", ""that being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers."", ""i wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, terroni or libretto, but bar salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't."", ""the promise of buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.""]",31,8
163,Hey Meatball,"Hey Meatball! Hey Mediocre! Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier/order taker/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.

For a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrée selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked ""what would I like it on?"" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with ""spaghetti,"" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.

We each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.

The food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.

The saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.

Hey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.","['hey meatball!', 'hey mediocre!', 'walking into hey meatball!', ""all great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable."", 'there was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made hey meatball!', 'mostly a letdown.']",28,149
164,3030,"3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.","['3030 has young-professional written all over it.', 'craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its junction location (sigh, i remember the days when they avoided this area).', 'and although i spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, i only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago.', ""in my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for."", ""with a gabby's now opened next door, i remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence."", ""it's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.""]",25,101
165,Buster's Sea Cove,"I know St. Lawrence market is full of great food, but I never would've thought that tucked way in the back of the building I'd find something quite like Buster's Sea Cove.

Keep in mind though, this takeout shop isn't Rodney's or Oyster Boy, and I'm definitely not trying to convince you that it is. In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.

Fresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.

But don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.

Buster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.

Chances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.

Truth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.","[""i know st. lawrence market is full of great food, but i never would've thought that tucked way in the back of the building i'd find something quite like buster's sea cove."", ""keep in mind though, this takeout shop isn't rodney's or oyster boy, and i'm definitely not trying to convince you that it is."", ""in fact, buster's sea cove isn't even in the same boat."", ""truth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much."", 'you might not even notice.', ""whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at buster's is just that dam good.""]",21,259
166,Sushi Marche,"This sushi restaurant at the corner of Queen and Caroline is a take-out superstar. You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!

Just like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.

Chef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.

Lunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.

Our dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.

Their fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.

If your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.","['this sushi restaurant at the corner of queen and caroline is a take-out superstar.', 'you can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance.', ""if you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!"", ""nori can easily become chewy and tough, but marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment."", ""i have to say i'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but i wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so i don't mind this one pre-prepared item."", 'if your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, sushi marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.']",18,50

168,Mitzi's Café,"For the past year or so, I've been meaning to go to Mitzi's Cafe for brunch.  Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.

I love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.

And like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).

Sitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.

As I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange/banana/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.

The glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.

This would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.","[""for the past year or so, i've been meaning to go to mitzi's cafe for brunch."", 'weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.', 'fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) i am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a tuesday...which is exactly what i did this week.', ""tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty."", 'this would have been a 4 star review had i made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.', ""mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the french toast (and i hear the oatmeal buttermilk pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.""]",31,79
169,Paese,"Relatively new to the King West theatre district, and across the street from the Bell Lightbox is, Paese.  New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.

With a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).

My server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.

Next, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.

As full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.

I had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.

Paese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...

Because of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.","['relatively new to the king west theatre district, and across the street from the bell lightbox is, paese.', 'new to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, paese has been operating out of their bathurst street location since 1989.  serving up italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, paese might give longtime district resident kit kat some competition.', 'with a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).', ""i was given a sample of a 2004 fumanelli amarone before committing to a full glass, after which i gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up."", ""rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as i'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...  because of its location, i probably won't make a repeat visit but i don't think paese is having a hard time attracting other customers."", 'i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.']",26,52
170,The Bar with No Name,"The Bar with No Name recently opened up in the place where the ever-empty Z-Bar used to be, and the signs of them still working out the kinks of being a newly opened place are still there. It was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else, and there was still a lot of remenants of Z-Bar to be found. I've been to Z-Bar once, and I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, except for the kick-ass, inviting new Bar With No Name sign out front.

Simply put, No Name's staff are amazing, thoughtful, and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be. They were really concerned with making sure we had a good time, and because of them, our experience was good. Even though the place was busy, they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushed.

No Name's food menu was the standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, and fried foods were front and center, but despite the plainness of the menu, the food was hot, fresh, and served the way it should be.

The music in this place, however, really needs some improvements. We probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasn't for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment. I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon. I left at 1030, and I never saw or heard a DJ, just Leon's, Loblaw's, and car commercials at full volume.

It does seem as though they rushed to open, and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together, but once they get it all worked out, this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangout.

Pachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron décor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.
Their menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entrée.

For our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalapeño peppers, Cazuela beans served with requesón-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. 

For those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalapeño in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. 

The drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. 

Overall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy décor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.","['there is a new kid in town, and his name is pachuco - named after the look and style of mexican youth back in the 1930s to 1950s that dressed in zoot suits.', ""pachuco opened its doors on friday, january 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success."", 'pachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron décor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign.', 'it seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so i imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own.', ""overall, i think these are minor complaints, especially since it was pachuco's opening preview."", ""i found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with latin music, candles and a few kitschy décor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'modern mexican' dining experience.""]",38,22

173,Drake BBQ,"Boy-oh-boy, do I ever feel let down. I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...

Drake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?

Nope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.

Because they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.

Welcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.

Besides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.

Like I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.","['boy-oh-boy, do i ever feel let down.', 'i actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when i was craving some good-ole-fashioned-bbq.', ""claiming to be serving it up in true southern-style, i thought that there's no way this could go wrong."", 'i felt let down.', 'it was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true southern bbq or southern hospitality.', ""in fact, i don't think i would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true southern bbq or not, i'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.""]",41,10
174,Foxley Bistro and Bar,"Tapas seem to be all the hype recently. And it's easy to see why. Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.

The restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of décor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.

My friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.

The first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings"" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..

Next came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.

After that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!

If you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!

And while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!

To balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.

Upon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as ""Asian fusion"" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.","['tapas seem to be all the hype recently.', ""and it's easy to see why."", ""not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group."", ""that does not go to say that i didn't enjoy my meal though."", 'while i found it was a little on the pricier side, i did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere.', 'keep foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.']",41,125
175,Disgraceland,"Disgraceland isn't bad, but it's definitely a bit overrated. Thier biggest fault is that it's completly hit-or-miss. Somedays everything comes together, other times... 

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.

But like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in. Food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care. 

Disappointingly enough, the one thing that you can count on that Disgraceland has that is consistently great, is one hell-of-a cool name.","[""disgraceland isn't bad, but it's definitely a bit overrated."", ""thier biggest fault is that it's completly hit-or-miss."", ""somedays everything comes together, other times...   their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless."", 'everything from southern-fried chicken and tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches.', ""they also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning."", ""the staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there."", 'but like i said, all of that can change the next time you go in.', 'food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care.', 'disappointingly enough, the one thing that you can count on that disgraceland has that is consistently great, is one hell-of-a cool name.']",9,109
176,The Burger's Priest,"I came across The Burger's Priest purely by accident one day when I was biking in the Beaches neighbourhood. It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. 

First off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.

The fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.

The space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.

Next time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.

177,The Kensington Cornerstone Restaurant,"The Kensington Cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.  It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.","['the kensington cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.', 'it has gluten free beer.', ""it has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent."", ""after we begrudgingly paid our bill, i decided to throw the whole gf thing out the window and head to ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note."", ""as we sat there on the patio i couldn't help but stare across the road at the grilled cheese."", 'oh, what could have been.']",51,41

194,Awesome Mannered Canines,"I can't say enough about what Brenda has done for us. My husband and I rescued Pepper and knew he was the dog for us despite the expected behavior problems coming from a rescued pup! She helped me identify the core of our issues with Pepper, and we faced them head-on! I had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment; sit, stay, free, park it (code for go lay down)- no problem! Our struggle was on walks and going anywhere. Pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle. I had zero control over him outside of the apartment. Brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home, and brought a variety of different dogs to increase Pepper's tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term ""LEAVE IT!"". 

Long story short, we are still working everyday to improve Pepper's socialization, but we recently had a doggy play date and he did AMAZING! I can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic, walk by cats without worry, and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice ""leave it"" a few times :) I am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk, or to bring him to new places!","[""i can't say enough about what brenda has done for us."", 'my husband and i rescued pepper and knew he was the dog for us despite the expected behavior problems coming from a rescued pup!', 'she helped me identify the core of our issues with pepper, and we faced them head-on!', 'i had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment; sit, stay, free, park it (code for go lay down)- no problem!', 'our struggle was on walks and going anywhere.', 'pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle.', 'i had zero control over him outside of the apartment.', 'brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home, and brought a variety of different dogs to increase pepper\'s tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term ""leave it!"".', ""long story short, we are still working everyday to improve pepper's socialization, but we recently had a doggy play date and he did amazing!"", 'i can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic, walk by cats without worry, and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice ""leave it"" a few times :) i am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk, or to bring him to new places!']",10,38

A friend sent flowers for my birthday which they tried to deliver late in the afternoon when I was not at home.  When the girl called she said that they would redeliver the flowers the next morning. I told her to bring them to my neighbor as that I would not be at home. My neighbor waited at home till 12 noon and no flowers arrived.  I  got home at 12 and called them and said where are my flowers?  The woman apologized and said that her supervisor would give me a call. Of course, no call. So, I called them yet again. They said they were on the truck and would be here by the end of the day.  Once again no flowers. So I called again and said, hey it's almost closing time for you where are my flowers? The answer was don't worry they'll be there.  They weren't.  Next morning my father waited at my house for the delivery of the missing flowers. Of course again no flowers.  So I called them at 12 noon again and said if I do not have them by the end of the day I would be coming into the store personally and picking up my flowers or canceling the order for my friend.

First off-- you do not come here for atmosphere.  They have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls.  The fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot.

Aside from the obvious, the church is utterly gorgeous, the people are what make this place truly spectacular.

There is a Buddhist group that meets here, a Sunday School class for LGBT and friends, and people of all colors.  The minister here is Stephen Shoemaker and he is incredibly educated, intellectual and compassionate.  He is a pillar in the faith community in Charlotte.  The outreach of this church is also impressive.  Service projects and taking care of thy neighbor abounds here.

There are great Sunday School classes for adults and children alike.  The little ones often are found riding tricycles in the gym after SS and during the church service.  There are sports teams, a gym, art classes, computer classes, etc... offered here.  We have participated in many and loved them all.

They also have really great small group offerings-- interested in art?  drinking beer at pubs?  going to movies?  and somehow tying this back into Christianity?  Or maybe you want to be an earth keeper, a hiker or a yogi?  They have it all.

I was thankful he told me this, as I was feeling like that but felt I was being paranoid.  Without that significant detail, this would be a 4 star park.  

I think the little splash park is big fun for younger children, although it can get quite crowded and there are, as always, those parents who do not monitor their children's behavior.

The playground is super fun!  Big, fast slide and great swings.  Great recycled plastic chips in lieu of mulch.

Awesome picnic shelter and wonderful, open field for kick ball or soccer.

216,Vestique,"One of life's most frustrating experiences is shopping for  (and with ) a middle school daughter.  She chose this as our destination.  Really, I was ready to open my wallet and just be done.  Too bad the sales staff was unhelpful and a little... rude.  I asked them, very pointedly, for help.  I knew my daughter would trust their opinion more than mine (and they were both wearing those mullet shirts --you know long in the back, short in the front-- and, well, that is just not a style I am able to work with, so I did not just want their help, I *needed* their help).  They nonchalantly pointed to a section of clothes that she ""might"" like.  I inquired about help with sizing, to which, again, I was met with no offer of help.  She tried on a few things but she was frustrated with sizing and I was annoyed, so we left, empty handed.

To be sure, this is not my style of clothing, but I know there are some school friends that have picked up some cute clothes in here.  With all the options available in Charlotte, and when I am paying full-retail pricing (to be fair-- their retail pricing is affordable/reasonable, hence 3 stars), I expect better and more helpful service.

218,The Fillmore Charlotte,"I love The Fillmore.  I was between 4 and 5 stars and the reason I went with 4 stars is because I paid $18 on Wednesday night for two Bud Lights.... and I think that is ridiculous.  And I am not a fan of the VIP seating they had on the second level for the Willie Nelson concert... it took up way too much room, making the venue feel a little overcrowded.  These seats were not there for the Black Crowes or Five for Fighting and I prefer them not to be there the next time I am lucky enough to take in a show here.

The bathrooms are great here, which is an added bonus and a surprise!

This venue is fantastic for those who love to get up close and for those who want a more intimate setting for a show.  Really, Willie was spectacular and I loved the small venue for such a big man.  It makes it nearly impossible to think of going to a coliseum/arena event.

It is the type of place that makes you dream of how you might decorate a beach house, a mountain house, a contemporary house, etc.. The prices are reasonable on most things.  Occasionally, I feel like the pricing has no rhyme or reason.

They tend to have great mid-century pieces but these move quickly!  A lot of their merchandise turns over, so it is always a new shopping experience.  If you see it and you want it-- BUY IT!  I have lost several great things because I wanted to ""think about it.""

The place is overflowing with wonderful local art.  I have noticed these pieces don't seem to sell as quickly as the furniture.

For the most part, the booths are well laid out with lovely inventory.  There are a few that could use a good makeover.

The people who work here are friendly, though I did buy an set of something and received a phone call that the price tag on the item was incorrect, it was not for both pieces of the pair but had been priced per item.  I was told I could either pay the new price or return the items.  I opted to return the items and they wanted it back within 24 hours.

He has called to check in on a very sick child, offering to work with our health care provider for in-home nursing care if we got too overwhelmed-- this all on a Saturday.

237,Charlotte Yoga,"I love Charlotte Yoga!  This is a friendly yoga studio without the pretense of some other studios.  The instructors are great-- Rowena, Angie and Jaime are my favorites.  And, when you go to a $5 class, not only are you getting a great class but also a great value!

The studio itself is clean, and has a lot of natural light streaming in from the floor to ceiling windows, which I like during my practice.  I feel a little claustrophobic in a hot studio that doesn't have windows.

The bathrooms are adequate (well the women's bathroom, did not check out the men's) with showers.  The hall does get crowded during class changes, but most studios have this issue.  They also have filtered water, fill up before you get into class!

The power classes that are offered after a hot class are little too hot, or I would give 5-stars.  Several times the classes that are advertised as ""in an 85 degree room"" have been in a 100 degree + room (I check the thermostat because I always wonder if something is wrong with me when my practice seems harder than normal!).  I have heard several people comment/complan about this issue.  Believe me, there is quite a difference between 85-87 degrees and 100 degrees!

This place is overflowing with friendly yogis.  My husband, who was really intimidated by the whole yoga thing, loves this place!  My top 2 studio in Charlotte.

The flat bread pizza with fig, arugula and prosciutto is perfect for sharing with a friend.  I am not a carnivore, so I remove the prosciutto from mine.  The crust is crispy, the figs are heaven!

243,YWCA Health & Fitness Center,"Hands down this place offers the BEST children's swim lessons in Charlotte-- and I know because we have tried what seems like all of them!

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.

Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing ""illegal"" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.  

We will be there this Winter doing their little Winter league swim team.

244,300 East,"As a member of the Matilda Wong society, I felt compelled to review old faithful... 300 East.

I love the atmosphere.  Who can't be enamored with this old house in the heart of Dilworth?  I am not sure if she (the house) is considered a Grand Dame by historians and architects but it certainly is by me!  

I love sitting downstairs in one of the booths to the right of the hostess stand for a long leisurely lunch on a Saturday, that may, or may not, include a glass of wine.  I love coming here in the Fall and sitting outside, hearing the fountain and looking at the sheep statue.  I love coming here in the Winter and sitting in the really small and cozy booth in the main dining room.  Really, I cannot think of a time when it isn't right to come here!

The hummus plate is a delicious way to start your meal.  If you are lucky the white bean and gouda soup will be the daily soup offering.. it is bowl-licking good.  All the specials I have ever tried are delicious...  But, I tend to gravitate toward a salad or, my favorite, the black bean tortilla (with lots of fresh avacado!).  My hubbie likes the usual-- a grinder-ish type sandwich, the tuna, or whichever pasta is on the menu.

There is a special drink here called the ""Matilda Wong""  and it is very, very wong.  It used to come in a smallish fishbowl (think beta fish) but is now served in a small pitcher.  When I say it is ""wong"", I mean it is strong, it is good for sharing but, plan on having a responsible driver.  They cut you off after 2, as they should.

Dinner:  I did not enjoy my dinner.  Get the fried chicken.  My husband did enjoy his buffalo chicken sandwich.  I had some kind of salad-- obviously not a great choice in a bar but there veggie selection is limited-- it was not great but what is great is their brunch.  I prefer that to their dinner menu.  They also offer bottomless mimosas and bloody marys but-- good grief-- who can partake in that at noon on a Sunday?  Not me.  If you can, stop reading right now and say a prayer of thanksgiving.   The french toast, the omelet, the toast and grits, is all great.

They have a good beer selection on tap.  What they do not have is a good wine selection... this is definitely an area in which they can (and should) improve.  They have several specialty cocktails which usually are good.  There bloody marys are delish... especially the bloody martin.  

They have a cute little side room that you can reserve for parties. They have also been generous in the community, hosting fundraisers of various sorts.  Their marketing campaign-- Leroy Fox for President-- was awesome.  I loved seeing those signs in front yards.  ""Free chicken for everyone.""

It gets loud and it can get crowded (very crowded) but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd.  On occasion you might want to get there early (bring a yard chair) if you want to grab a general admission seat (just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you, and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring) and reserve your seat... now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start!  Seriously, it is that friendly... but, remember your seats won't allow for you to view the show, which is great for say, a husband who got dragged to see the IG.  

There are seats upstairs that are sometimes open, sometimes included in the GA price and sometimes reserved, just check the show listing.  There is also a VIP seating area that comes with a server.

Snickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  

Elephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).

Sugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!

Cupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.

Cakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.

261,Electric Mud BBQ,"Extremely disappointing.

This place had been on my To-Try list for a while now. I came with three friends on a Saturday night when it was not too busy. I ordered the beef ribs ($16.50) with a side of potato salad ($4.00). My friends ordered the pork ribs ($16.00), along with a few appetizers.

What bothered me about the service was that they just sort of drop the food off at the table to no one in particular. Ideally, the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it, or at the very least ask, ""Okay who ordered the so-and-so?"" and place it in front of whoever answers. Also, delivery should be simultaneous. Two of my friends got their dish, and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for ours.

For $16.50, I received TWO beef ribs with barely any meat on them. In my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone. These were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special. My friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.

First time in a very long while where I tipped less than 15%.","['extremely disappointing.', 'this place had been on my to-try list for a while now.', 'i came with three friends on a saturday night when it was not too busy.', 'i ordered the beef ribs ($16.50) with a side of potato salad ($4.00).', 'my friends ordered the pork ribs ($16.00), along with a few appetizers.', 'for $16.50, i received two beef ribs with barely any meat on them.', 'in my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone.', 'these were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special.', 'my friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.', 'first time in a very long while where i tipped less than 15%.']",15,243

Well, these friends of hers have either really low standards or just don't know the difference between good, quality food and junk.

All of us ordered the shoyu ribs ramen.  To say that it was disappointing would be an understatement.  The soup was luke-warm at best and it tasted almost sweet.  Ramen is supposed to be savory, so the sweet-ish soup was a major no-no.  The noodles were also sad.  It tasted like the instant stuff.  Gross.  Supposedly, their other menu items (i.e. gogi beef stuffed waffles) are supposed to be better, but that is a chance that I am not willing to take.

Their decorations/furnishings were quite interesting.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was their Transformer-like chairs.  They had some anime characters painted on the wall and had some anime show/movie playing silently on a tv.  The place was insanely dark that we were blinded when we were walking outside to leave.

318,Polished Nails & Spa,"I'm not sure why there are so many negative comments, I had a good experience here.  The main reason I tried this place is because of the location, only being about 5 minutes away from my house.  Christina did my nails, extremely helpful and nice.  She took her time to get me the the exact color I wanted, talked to me and offered me a drink.  I went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid I wouldn't be able to squeeze in a pedicure, but Christina was fast and efficient to make sure I had enough time.  Another woman (I forgot her name :( ) did my pedicure when everyone was already packed up and ready to leave so I really appreciated that.  It seriously was the best pedicure I've ever had, all the tough skin I had on my feet gone.  A lot of people complain about the laziness of the owner, but I didn't see him fooling around.  A nail lady's phone was going off and he was attentive to put her ringer on silent, and sorting through the receipts with the receptionist. 

Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.

Sammy looks at the ice cream scooper who took our order and asks, ""Did he ask for peanut butter?"" ....she says no.  Seriously little girl?  We were all there, we had a discussion about not having peanut butter ice cream...how can you try and manage this lie?

We all just looked at each other shocked and the girl who took our order stated, ""My bad."" as if she really thought that was a proper apology.  Wow.  So we all walked out.

 I will not be coming here again, just because I'm worried for MY well being.  I wanted to throw my fiance's shake at Sammy aka leader on duty's head for being such a rude brat.

322,Live Organic Food Bar - Liberty Village,"I've been waiting for Live Market to open for a while. From the moment I saw the familiar ""Live"" sign appear in Liberty Village, I've been waiting. They opened in the week I was out of town visiting family, so for a week, I watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of Liberty/Niagara so I too could eat this stuff too.

Live Market is conveniently(?) located right near my gym, so I have been here three times in a fairly short time period, and it's nice to have such a great post-workout option, and really extra nice to have a close non-starbucks coffee/tea option near my house.

Both times I've actually ordered food, it's been very very tasty. First time - the chickpea burger, second time, upon the recommendation of the server - Burdock Burrito (Do order this. It is yummy.) Live Market also keeps me in Silk Road earl grey tea. I've had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of Liberty Village work folks coming in on their lunch break.

I often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors. My partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order, so not only did they make it right, they apologized, and offered him a coffee for his trouble. Smooth. Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.

They've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. 

There are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things. You can buy protein powder, tea, coffee, and even make up. They also have jars of Rawtella for sale, which I wouldn't call ""healthy"", but I would call really really delicious (since I did end up buying some on my last visit...)

Service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and I feel like I get good value for my money when I go there.

Things to know: They don't have debit/credit working yet, but it's coming soon. I.E., At the moment it's Cash Only.","[""i've been waiting for live market to open for a while."", 'from the moment i saw the familiar ""live"" sign appear in liberty village, i\'ve been waiting.', 'they opened in the week i was out of town visiting family, so for a week, i watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of liberty/niagara so i too could eat this stuff too.', 'they also have jars of rawtella for sale, which i wouldn\'t call ""healthy"", but i would call really really delicious (since i did end up buying some on my last visit...)  service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and i feel like i get good value for my money when i go there.', ""things to know: they don't have debit/credit working yet, but it's coming soon."", ""i.e., at the moment it's cash only.""]",20,39
323,Grasslands,"Like most Veg-o's I was a little sad when Fressen announced they were closing. Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)

A group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still ""evolving"" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen. 

The Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)

The Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating. 

Another pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.

Food is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.

Major problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.

I'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.

To sum it up: Food is okay. Service is good. Bar (and associated menu) is great. Interior is great.","[""like most veg-o's i was a little sad when fressen announced they were closing."", 'not because i particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being vegetarian haven, without wine.)', 'a group of 7 of us went on their second day.', 'service is good.', 'bar (and associated menu) is great.', 'interior is great.']",28,64
324,Linuxcaffe,"Since this place is one of the Indie Coffee Passport stops, I skipped buying my typical latte and ordered a (vegan) soup instead. I asked the server if the bread that came with it was vegan too, and he said he didn't think so. 

Now, this is the part I really liked. He quietly gave me a bit of a discount on the soup (which is normally 3.95) I thought that was a nice (and unexpected) touch. He was very friendly in general, and asked me how my soup was when he walked by later. 

I wish they got their vegan baked goods from somewhere other than ""OMG Baked Goodness"" because I can't support that place at all. Please get some Sweets From the Earth!

It's got free wifi (yey!)
It charges extra for soy milk (booo!)

325,The Workroom Studio,"Today I successfully made a pillowcase. I'm so proud I had to tell Yelp. But seriously, I love this little store, and I'm sad that it took me so long to visit, but I anticipate visiting more frequently in the future.

I took the Basic Sewing Essentials class on a whim, and now I can't wait to take more. The classes are small (just 6 people) and easy to follow. The instructor was helpful, with good advice on troubleshooting machine problems, threading issues, and other sewing machine stuff. I left feeling like I had learned something that I could actually do again without  being confused. Karyn, the owner, was our instructor and came around regularly to check on everyone and offer help or advice.

There is a store dog, and initially, that was weird, but in a good way. I usually don't like dogs, but this one is laid back, friendly (but not too friendly) and spent most of her time on the couch in the back. 

The fabric selection is awesome. So many different colours and textures. They have fat quarters in various styles and colours, notions, patterns, and other supplies.

Really positive experience, and I would recommend it if you're looking for fabric, or if you're looking to start taking sewing classes.","['today i successfully made a pillowcase.', ""i'm so proud i had to tell yelp."", ""but seriously, i love this little store, and i'm sad that it took me so long to visit, but i anticipate visiting more frequently in the future."", ""i took the basic sewing essentials class on a whim, and now i can't wait to take more."", 'the classes are small (just 6 people) and easy to follow.', ""i usually don't like dogs, but this one is laid back, friendly (but not too friendly) and spent most of her time on the couch in the back."", 'the fabric selection is awesome.', 'so many different colours and textures.', 'they have fat quarters in various styles and colours, notions, patterns, and other supplies.', ""really positive experience, and i would recommend it if you're looking for fabric, or if you're looking to start taking sewing classes.""]",14,19

Eight has a modern decor, good atmosphere, and while I was there, a live DJ. There were television screens in the wall playing oh so hipply distorted Alfred Hitchcock movies.

When I walked in it was mostly empty, the bartender was friendly, and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive. 

I ordered a terrible wine, the name of which I have forgotten, but that's not their fault. I picked something local and cheap. They have a great wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.

The server was kind enough to keep offering to fill up my glass of water at least 5 times after I finished that 1 glass of (terrible) wine.

329,Merchants of Green Coffee,"The first time Merchants of Green coffee was recommended by a barista at another coffee shop, I put it on my mental To Visit list. She had mentioned that it didn't look like a place you could go inside and drink coffee, so I was slightly more prepared for the remote location, but I still got lost on the way.

Unfortunately the day I went in, they had run out of regular soy milk, and considering I've been ordering a soy latte from everywhere... that was a bit of a disappointment. They don't have soy milk, so one of the barista's happily suggested 2%. I'm not sure how that's an equivalent option, but (obviously) I didn't go for it.

Luckily there was someone else there, and he offered me a very awesome tasty latte made with So Nice soy creamer (which is a lot thicker than regular soymilk). He warned me it might be too sweet. But no, it was delicious and a great cozy cup of coffee (and now I kind of wish people always made me lattes with that heavy soy creamer...).

Wandering through their location is a bit like visiting a mini coffee museum.

Honestly, the store was a madhouse when I got in. There were over a dozen customers inside and 4-5 customer service agents in the store.

But, I waited only around five minutes to talk to someone, and in a little over 15 minutes I was set up with a new account, with the plan I wanted (at 50% off for 6 months) and a new phone (on WindTab). 

Daniel S was super helpful, gave me all the pertinent info I needed, answered my questions, and hooked me up with a phone number I might actually be able to remember. Everyone working in there seemed friendly and approachable, so that's a plus.

Dear restaurants, if you have something labelled ""vegan"" on the menu, could you let your staff know what ""vegan"" actually means? Thank you.

We waited about 20 minutes to get our orders. After I picked out the big tasteless spears of tofu out of my not so juicy  ""Juicy Vegan"" it wasn't so bad.

My table was covered in magazines (so if you don't bring reading material, you're more than covered), they have wifi and I read and finished a book without interruption (it's quiet). I'd probably go back eventually, buy a coffee I might not even like, solely to hang around. Maybe that's why there isn't much seating, there is a certain dark homey comfort to this place I can't quite put my finger on, but I like it.

While I'm happy they offer soy AND almond milk, I don't like that they charge extra for it.","['i had a terrible latte here.', 'bitter, weak foam, and unexciting.', 'maybe it was a bad day to go in, since i walked in on boxing day, and it was one of the only open cafes.', ""i might give it a do over after i'm done with the rest of my indie coffee passport stops, but i'm not in any rush."", 'i enjoyed the space itself though, that wide open emptiness.', ""my table was covered in magazines (so if you don't bring reading material, you're more than covered), they have wifi and i read and finished a book without interruption (it's quiet)."", ""i'd probably go back eventually, buy a coffee i might not even like, solely to hang around."", ""maybe that's why there isn't much seating, there is a certain dark homey comfort to this place i can't quite put my finger on, but i like it."", ""while i'm happy they offer soy and almond milk, i don't like that they charge extra for it.""]",9,31
340,Float Toronto,"I went for my first ever float yesterday evening and I really liked it. Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.

I've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.

So this is what happens when you walk in.

I had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. 

The doors lock, so you have some privacy.

I had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.

Each room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.

The flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. 

At first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.

When your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.

There is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)

There was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.

I think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. 

The one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.","['i went for my first ever float yesterday evening and i really liked it.', 'staff at float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while i waited for my turn to go in.', 'it was very relaxing.', ""the one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto queen street at 1 am on a friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy)."", ""i know i'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time."", 'otherwise, i had a really great time.']",26,34
341,Café 260,"Another one of those lovely places that I'd probably have missed if it were 
not for the Indie Coffee Passport.

First thing Saturday morning, I went over there to meet up with Nicole H. for a minicoffee crawl.

I got there way too early, but the moment I walked in, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out, chatting with Bob (the owner) like he was an old friend. 

I ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good. Thick, with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema. And I just loved the cup. I commented on it in my head and then again to Nicole H when she got there. It was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands. Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!

Other things that are great: 
- They have free wifi (when I went in, the password was on the chalkboard at the front)  
- There is definitely an outlet at the back corner. I didn't look anywhere else, but there is at least one!
- There are vegan snacks, soups, sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan options.

Complaints: 
- None really. It's a bit out of the way for me, but I would go back anyway.","[""another one of those lovely places that i'd probably have missed if it were  not for the indie coffee passport."", 'first thing saturday morning, i went over there to meet up with nicole h. for a minicoffee crawl.', 'i got there way too early, but the moment i walked in, i instantly felt comfortable and welcome.', '- there are vegan snacks, soups, sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan options.', 'complaints:  - none really.', ""it's a bit out of the way for me, but i would go back anyway.""]",18,35
342,Scotiabank Theatre,"We went and saw a movie here on Telus Tuesday, where we got a discounted movie ticket, and a free popcorn and a drink. The combo ticket was cheaper than buying a regular ticket. Can't go wrong with that. Avoiding the massive price of snacks is always nice.

It's close to the Osgoode Subway station, I loved the copious self-serve machines,  and the seats were comfy. 

What is with the bathrooms though? First of all, they were kind of hard to find, and secondly, for a big theater there aren't very many stalls. I'm glad I went on a Tuesday in the middle of a movie, because I can't imagine what that looks like on a Friday or Saturday.","['we went and saw a movie here on telus tuesday, where we got a discounted movie ticket, and a free popcorn and a drink.', 'the combo ticket was cheaper than buying a regular ticket.', ""can't go wrong with that."", 'avoiding the massive price of snacks is always nice.', ""it's close to the osgoode subway station, i loved the copious self-serve machines,  and the seats were comfy."", 'what is with the bathrooms though?', ""first of all, they were kind of hard to find, and secondly, for a big theater there aren't very many stalls."", ""i'm glad i went on a tuesday in the middle of a movie, because i can't imagine what that looks like on a friday or saturday.""]",8,140
343,Rawlicious,"Working in the Yorkville area, I've come here regularly for lunch. I love the location and the interior. It's a nice break from the everyday, and it's automatically relaxing. Calm, ignorable, music fills the restaurant, interspersed with the occasional loud whirring of a blender.

I like that there is always a bottle of water on the table, because I end up getting a couple litres of my H2O intake for the day while I'm there.

I've ordered a bunch of different things, but the Pad Thai was easily (and most expensively)  my favourite. Nice filling serving, with a fresh rich flavour.

The nacho plate is pretty delicious too, but as some other reviewers have mentioned, don't expect a giant nacho plate portion here. It's not huge, but paired with a meal it's a nice snack.

Smoothies are always thinner than I expect them to be (and after ordering it several times you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not) so that's something to be aware of and set less thick mouthfeel expectations. 

Overall I like it here. I do find it feels expensive, especially since there is no guarantee of organic ingredients, but service is always good and not intrusive.

p.s. Get a macaroon (or three) they're delicious.","[""working in the yorkville area, i've come here regularly for lunch."", 'i love the location and the interior.', ""it's a nice break from the everyday, and it's automatically relaxing."", 'calm, ignorable, music fills the restaurant, interspersed with the occasional loud whirring of a blender.', ""i like that there is always a bottle of water on the table, because i end up getting a couple litres of my h2o intake for the day while i'm there."", ""smoothies are always thinner than i expect them to be (and after ordering it several times you'd think i'd be used to it by now, but i'm not) so that's something to be aware of and set less thick mouthfeel expectations."", 'overall i like it here.', 'i do find it feels expensive, especially since there is no guarantee of organic ingredients, but service is always good and not intrusive.', 'p.s.', ""get a macaroon (or three) they're delicious.""]",14,60
344,Dark Horse Espresso,"I went to here the other day. It had a lot of places to sit (most of which were occupied), free wifi, but no power outlets that I could find.

The latte I had was beautiful, but not super exciting flavourwise. I've been spoiled entirely by the Sam James Espresso Bar. The one from here, was probably the second best one I've had in the city so far though.

It seems like the perfect place for both hanging out (there are cozy spaces behind the coffee bar) and group work (they have giant tables by the windows) and it's a great location (close to Kensiginton Market.) 

They do charge extra for soy milk, and it was the second most expensive latte I've had, but I loved the space and would definitely go there again.

It was crowded and very white, modernish interior, with an absolutely beautiful espresso machine. Their chairs aren't comfy and the interior was brightly lit with natural light from all the windows, so it's definitely set up as more of a pick up and go place than a sit down for a while place.

They charge extra for soy milk, and did so when it pushed the price over the $4 dollar Indie Coffee Passport limit. The service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay, but wasn't spectacular. 

They don't have any vegan baked items, though I think they had something gluten free while we were there.  Since I have too many options for really fabulous vegan friendly indie coffee shops in the neighbourhood I probably wont return to Thor.","['i walk by this place on the regular, and through the power of the indie coffee passport, i decided to actually go in and check it out.', 'it was crowded and very white, modernish interior, with an absolutely beautiful espresso machine.', ""their chairs aren't comfy and the interior was brightly lit with natural light from all the windows, so it's definitely set up as more of a pick up and go place than a sit down for a while place."", 'they charge extra for soy milk, and did so when it pushed the price over the $4 dollar indie coffee passport limit.', ""the service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay, but wasn't spectacular."", ""they don't have any vegan baked items, though i think they had something gluten free while we were there."", 'since i have too many options for really fabulous vegan friendly indie coffee shops in the neighbourhood i probably wont return to thor.']",7,79
347,Herbal Infusions Tea Co,"I'm really digging this tea shop. I'm not in the area as often as I'd like to be, but when I am, I usually stop in for a cup of tea.

Service has been lovely.  The owner is consistently a nice, helpful person, and answers questions about tea and recommends things as needed.

They've got a nice variety of in house made tea blends. But since I'm a creature of habit (at least with tea) I will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever.

348,Ravi Soups,"We ended up at Ravi's Soups on Queen Street a few days ago, after a failed attempt to check out E.L. Ruddy (they were closed).

Ravi's Soups had a big group of people waiting for wraps, so that was a nice sign. They had a veggie wrap on the menu, and a vegan soup option. That said, I wasn't excited about this place from the very beginning.  Service was weird and all over the place, there wasn't a line waiting by the time we were at the counter, but he was still frenetic and rushed, but the food didn't come to us for quite a long time, and as with most simple vegetable dishes, I feel like I could have probably just made the wrap at home.

The veggie wrap normally has brie in it, and jut as a heads up, one of the unlisted additions is mayo... so you know if you're vegan, ask for it without, or just skip it and just opt for soup. (or go somewhere else.) The wrap came with a tiny salad, that of course, had ""just a little bit"" of mayo on it, I guess ""a little bit"" of mayo is the same as ""no mayo""? Not quite.

My friend had the wrap and the Porcini Mushroom Soup and loved it. It's based on an onion broth, and has mushrooms, barley, and truffle oil in it, so it's actually vegan. However, soups all come with a cheese biscuit.

This place, like most of Toronto's restaurants, is great for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, but going there made me wish I had gone somewhere else on Queen that was a bit more vegan friendly with more exciting options.","[""we ended up at ravi's soups on queen street a few days ago, after a failed attempt to check out e.l. ruddy (they were closed)."", ""ravi's soups had a big group of people waiting for wraps, so that was a nice sign."", 'they had a veggie wrap on the menu, and a vegan soup option.', ""that said, i wasn't excited about this place from the very beginning."", ""service was weird and all over the place, there wasn't a line waiting by the time we were at the counter, but he was still frenetic and rushed, but the food didn't come to us for quite a long time, and as with most simple vegetable dishes, i feel like i could have probably just made the wrap at home."", 'not quite.', 'my friend had the wrap and the porcini mushroom soup and loved it.', ""it's based on an onion broth, and has mushrooms, barley, and truffle oil in it, so it's actually vegan."", 'however, soups all come with a cheese biscuit.', ""this place, like most of toronto's restaurants, is great for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, but going there made me wish i had gone somewhere else on queen that was a bit more vegan friendly with more exciting options.""]",13,67

Frank has a vegan dish on their brunch menu, the roasted shiitake mushrooms with heirloom squash, which was nice to see. The server suggested a slightly more substantial dish the chef could make for us with braised lentils and eggplant (also with heirloom squash and tat soi salad). It was phenominal.

498,Japas,"Kaki Furai (Deep fried oysters) - $8
I don't love oysters but I actually liked this. The batter was crispy and thin and the oysters weren't dried out.

6-pack - $12
The outside of the nori was encrusted with...I want to say it was panko. It didn't look like deep fried sushi rice on the outside to me.

Spicy tuna 2 styles - $6
The pieces on the far left/right were spicy and the inside pieces were plain. Reminded me of bruschetta. But better.

Wild Jumbo Shrimp Tempura - $8
I don't mind wasabi but I wish it was on the side. Otherwise, I liked the big shrimp and the batter.

Mini Okonomiyaki - $6
Nothing spectacular, but a bit too much bonito flakes

Yaki Scallop - $12
These scallops were too dry for my liking.

Salmon on rice in soup - ?
That's literally what it was to me. The broth was interesting. At the end of each bite, there was a floral scent. It was like flower-scented soup. Not bad, but just unexpected.

Service
The staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. It would've been nice if they had told us which dish was which without being asked.

Reservations
We had to call a few times before getting through to book a reservation. The deal said that reservations had to be made 24 hours in advance but we called in the afternoon and got a seat for 7pm. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was almost full by the time we left around 9. We assumed it would be busier later on as it was more of a late night eats place (5pm-2am).

Menu/prices
I probably wouldn't go back if I didn't have a group deal like the one we had. We ordered 8 dishes and a beer.

Spicy pork neck tacos ($10 for 2 tacos)
I liked the amount of meat and cabbage in the tacos.

Spicy pork buns ($9) - 1 burger cut into quarters
I liked that the buns were soft. We tasted the same spicy sauce in the tacos as the tacos. It was good but didn't jump out at me.

Soo yook - 48-hour braised beef ($12)
I'd skip this one

""Galbi ssäm"" set - short rib ($20)
I liked the galbi. Flavourful and not too much fat (I usually leave the fat behind).

However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.

I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.

People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.

And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up.

It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.
Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.

I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.

My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.

Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour.

I have been dropping by for lunch three or four days a month often with a friend since the current owners remodeled the former Tokyo Sushi opposite  St, Paul's Chuch (where Tafelmusik plays).

The food decor and atmosphere have stepped up greatly. I have tried many items but my fave is the Chef Combi with salmon teriyaki and sushi. it includes generous sashimi as well. Many veggie items too.

Only a light dinner needed after such a feast.

No friend has ever disliked Maido and my friends are 
Mostly picky foodies.

There was  only  one other diner and about five staff.

No big deal being served , right?

Not that there was much effort to break off conversation and speak to me as I waited for a welcome. Finally ordered and having confirmed with the pleasant cashier that yes I would like tartar sauce, I was then asked by two different servers if I happened to want tartar sauce. 

It seems that the staff don't pay much attention.

 I told the last one that I had been asked twice already and received no reply, though in the end the sauce was supplied.

Pacific haddock was tasty but more batter than fish and the chips were lukewarm, far from piping hot as they need to be for taste and texture.

Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalapeño to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away. 

If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. 

Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. 

The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. 

Complimentary salad was small cute and good. 

The miso soup was good. 

Tea was average. 

Ginger is really good here.

Wasabi is really weak here.

In the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good. 


Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20) 


Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there.

569,Adrenaline Body Piercing & Tattoos,"All I have to say is .... if you're going to get a tattoo and want it done RIGHT and like no other place in toronto go see RAIDEL at adrenaline!!!! 

I originally had an amaZing tattoo artist in Kensington (Vince) who unfortunately moved back to Venice, Italy. Fate brought me to the hands of the very talented RAIDEL! 

His passion for creative designs and art is phenomenal! He has done quite a large AMAZING piece on me and most of it he just did FREEHAND  (That is talent!)  

The thing I LOVE the MOST about his many talents is the fact that he has something that I find is SO RARE in a tattoo artist... he can create that FLOW into making your tattoo not look like a stamp ... but a part of you... an art that can even take previous pieces and make them one! I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.     

Adrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT. If I wasn't so broke ass I would give him a HUGE TIP as appreciation for his VERY hard work and TALENT! I intend to repay him some day by surprise for the lack of the TIP he deserved that I didn't have at the time.

The bad - the younger lady who served us seemed like she does not like her job ... She made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance ... She seemed a little arrogant too.... And was not very familiar with the desserts. 
I am not a fan of lemon desserts but I do not mind something with a tiny note of it (as I know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them) ... When I specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert. I also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino. 

I love the heart of this place ... It was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as I have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment. 

The good- Love the desserts here I usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern Italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture, the flavour and the combination of them! 
The bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them (I am sure you will love it! ) 

The coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which I love.


I try to ignore the treatment I got here last time .....because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us .....but to be honest that's no excuse, ever ...

I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!

Side note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter!

616,SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas,"I want to like this place SO MUCH.  The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  

To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would ""incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes""--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue ""fighting"".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. 

If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. 

In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.","['i want to like this place so much.', 'the food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is tdf), but the service we got was horrible.', 'our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.', ""in short, come here if you're in a small group."", 'the food really is worth it, many times over.', ""i'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one i had in a large group.""]",19,2269

The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor.

The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there. 

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense.

626,Great Wall Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture,"I have been successfully treated by Dr. Xiao for 2 very different conditions.

1) I suffered a CTD / RSI hand/wrist injury due to my profession.  Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  

Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.

2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.

She is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life.","['i have been successfully treated by dr. xiao for 2 very different conditions.', '1) i suffered a ctd / rsi hand/wrist injury due to my profession.', ""rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests."", 'for a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.', 'unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.', '2) i had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.', 'dr. xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.', 'she used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.', 'she is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that i have ever met, and she truly loves her work.', 'i cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life.']",14,23

680,Appliance Certified,"Wow... talk about the absolute WORST company I've ever tried to do business with.  It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  

I used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. 

However, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. 

Bottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.

717,Seoul Korean Grill,"I love it here!

But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).

Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.

And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.   

I must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!

718,Cleo Beauty Salon,"I'm so glad I found this salon!!! After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.

But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!

I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.

I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)

I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)

Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. 

I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid.

Anyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.

Look, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.

I've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.  

Anyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.

So I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.

744,Charlotte Motor Speedway,Kudos to Charlotte Motor Speedway!! They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!!

774,The Climbing Wall,"I'm mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additions.

General
- Bad ventilation. With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.
- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing
= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.

Bouldering area
+ Decent number of routes and variety
- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere

Top rope area
-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.
- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?
- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.
- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.","[""i'm mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additions."", 'general - bad ventilation.', 'with pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.', 'i waited for the employee to look away so i could safely set up a top rope.', 'discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.', ""maybe i'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in san francisco where i live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.""]",18,44

The only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still bad.

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge. The resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore. The gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment- no waiting like at the gym back home!

We gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said it's a must visit. They make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose from.

We got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the non-profit organisation behind the museum - it's great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junk.

It's an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the 'boneyard' the guide gave us some great (and humorous) history about Las Vegas.

802,Maizal,"Relaxing atmosphere, educational chalk based corn diagrams, and air conditioning... what more could you ask for? Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan/veg ones.

The menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)

Other things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. 

Outdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.

We each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)

The fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.

p.s. prices are reasonable.","['relaxing atmosphere, educational chalk based corn diagrams, and air conditioning... what more could you ask for?', 'well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious.', 'maizal is a recent addition to the liberty village area.', ""the folks at maizal are doing exciting things with food, and i'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them."", 'p.s.', 'prices are reasonable.']",25,100

We dropped in on a Saturday morning and it was mostly empty.  Walking by, it looks like an old antique furniture store with a random assortment of unmatched pieces.

No, but really, I like random, and I like the atmosphere, it's weird but well lit. I'll call it... cozy. I liked the big wooden table by the window I didn't have any luck connecting to their wifi with my ipod but I saw other people on laptops tapping away. Minimal plug ins, but they exist.

It was a beautiful looking cup of coffee, but it may have also been the worst almond latte I've ever drank. I think it's great that they offer almond milk, but I'm not convinced they knew how to use it that day. Overall... my problem was that the coffee was very bitter. Way too bitter.

It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.

Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.

Also - wifi.Free functional wifi. There are outlets all over the place if you look for them (one main one that I know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating. Yes.

807,Hot Beans,"I'm late to the Hot Beans praising party, but not late in trying out their delicious tacos and donuts. Taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry, but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of that.

So what can I say, I haven't eaten anything here I didn't like. The tacos are all delicious (though my favourite is the Yuba), and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans, cashew cream cheese, some kind of cheese sauce and veggies. I've been eyeing those burritos, but haven't gotten around to ordering one yet.

I'm happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench, along with a help yourself collection of water jugs. You might notice the lack of garbage can, well, everything is biodegradable. Which is awesome, but I can't help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so I don't waste any more paper bags on donuts I inhale in 5 minutes anyway.

The limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes, but otherwise I have no serious complaints. Service depends on the day and who's at the counter, but it's usually somewhere between decent and awesome.

The seating is limited to about 9-12 people depending on where you're sitting, but it hasn't felt crowded any of the (several several several) times I've gone in. There is a lot of foot traffic, people running in and out to grab a quick bite. 

The simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated, just enough choice, without too much choice. What you see on the board, is what you will pay (tax is included), and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciate.

I haven't checked them out for breakfast on the weekends, but it's definitely on my to do list. Breakfast burritos... tempting, tempting.

808,Disgraceland,"I've lived in Toronto for two whole years as of this month, and I have never once had  a bad time there. More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I got a vegan burrito and didn't feel deprived of anything, it was a nice big meal. I really liked how they constructed it. It made a huge difference when biting in. There was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual ""oh here's rice, oh here's lettuce, oh here's salsa""  feeling I get from some other places. It was quite filling, though I probably could have eaten two for lunch. I think grilling the burrito is a nice touch, crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside. 

They have veggie ground round, and vegan guacamole, and hot sauce that's actually hot. I wish they also had some daiya, because that would have made this place all around perfect.

My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly.

I went through the self check out, you know, so I could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly? Instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.

He hovered and hassled me the entire time I was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that I was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating. It totally ruined the whole experience for me. 

If I do go back, I'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and I don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process.

I would have given this place a five, I wanted to give this place a two after I left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location.","[""i'd like to say i loved this place, because for the most part i did."", 'the veggie selection was beautiful, the store was bright and clean, but ultimately, all of that was ruined by my experience at the check out.', 'i went through the self check out, you know, so i could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly?', 'instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.', 'he hovered and hassled me the entire time i was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that i was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating.', 'it totally ruined the whole experience for me.', ""if i do go back, i'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and i don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process."", 'i would have given this place a five, i wanted to give this place a two after i left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location.']",8,103
817,Vegetarian Haven,"First of all, this is probably the best Vegetarian restaurant I've been to in the Toronto area, and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants I've been to in North America.

I took a big burly omnivore with me, and he loved everything we ordered, so I take that as a great sign.

We started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings. I wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because I can never have enough, they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for it.

We both ordered the Special of the Day, which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens, with a side of noodles, and a flavour explosion of a mango salad. 

Our waitress totally sold it. Her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning. It adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly, and she was wonderful. Moreover, she clearly loved the place and the food, which is exactly the type of person I want advising me on what to order.

I was feeling pretty full after finishing my plate, but there is always room for dessert. My dining companion and I shared a piece of chocolate cake and a brownie sundae (but since they were out of brownie, they used lightly warmed chocolate cookies.)  What can I say, other than delicious! delicious! delicious! 

The chocolate cake was good, but not as good as the sundae. Though I'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am.

In Short: 
- order the crispy mushrooms, you wont be disappointed. 
- And the Special; it's consistently amazing.","[""first of all, this is probably the best vegetarian restaurant i've been to in the toronto area, and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants i've been to in north america."", 'i took a big burly omnivore with me, and he loved everything we ordered, so i take that as a great sign.', 'we started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings.', ""though i'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am."", 'in short:  - order the crispy mushrooms, you wont be disappointed.', ""- and the special; it's consistently amazing.""]",18,201
818,Bloomer's,"I've been travelling a lot lately and in the time I was away having fun and eating lots of great food, Bloomers opened and I was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this (still) new vegan cafe and bakery in Bloorcourt.

So finally,I got to visit them today. 

First impressions are: I love the wide open space, that there are multiple options for seating (booths, tables, high tables, etc). They've got free wifi (I didn't look for power outlets this time). Service was really nice and friendly. And I felt pretty comfortable just hanging out with my coffee for a bit

Today I saw a couple of different kinds of donuts, fluffy coconut donut holes, chocolate chip cookies, butter tarts, blueberry tarts, BAGELS, and a donut Bread pudding, and probably more, but I was especially drawn to the bagels, as I haven't seen bagels around any of the fine vegan bakeries we have in our city AND I happen to really like bagels (and usually end up making them myself). as an added bonus they had tofutti cream cheese available. 

They've got a variety of kombuchas, teas, blue sky soda, and assorted bottled fruit juices, in addition to fancy (and more regular) coffee options. 

I hear there is a menu extension coming in September with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so I'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears.

I liked it here, I would (and will) be back again soon. 

Accessibility-wise: Today the door was wide open (otherwise it's not powered), but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in. And  in a wonderful departure from the usual Toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floor.

And regarding one of the other reviews... it seems a little (no, it seems a lot) ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe.","[""i've been travelling a lot lately and in the time i was away having fun and eating lots of great food, bloomers opened and i was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this (still) new vegan cafe and bakery in bloorcourt."", 'so finally,i got to visit them today.', 'first impressions are: i love the wide open space, that there are multiple options for seating (booths, tables, high tables, etc).', ""they've got free wifi (i didn't look for power outlets this time)."", 'service was really nice and friendly.', ""i hear there is a menu extension coming in september with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so i'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears."", 'i liked it here, i would (and will) be back again soon.', ""accessibility-wise: today the door was wide open (otherwise it's not powered), but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in."", 'and  in a wonderful departure from the usual toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floor.', 'and regarding one of the other reviews... it seems a little (no, it seems a lot) ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe.']",13,117

Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew. 

I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a ""healthy"" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able. 

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5.","[""i come here about once every two weeks, mostly out of convenience, since it's near my workplace, has vegan options, and offers a decent alternative to subway/sushi/pizza options i have in the area."", ""service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other indian restaurants do in the area."", 'ew.', ""i've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland."", 'they are spiced but not really (especially if you\'ve gotten used to more authentic little india flavours) and just generally have a ""healthy"" flavor to them.', ""it's not terrible, but miss-able."", ""i'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.)"", ""they do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice."", ""they've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5.""]",9,26

They have a great selection of games in the back, and various events happen every week, including a Scrabble meetup group (Scrabble in the City) every Thursday night.

Beer and other alcohol selection appears ample, but since it was 3 pm on a Wednesday, I opted for tea. Prices for food and drinks are very reasonable, as of yet, there is no game playing fee.

It still didn't win me over.  But this visit was better than before.

Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers ""helping"" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.

Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.

I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.

I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good.

Great selection of random products. They have grain based pseudo-meats, and a very interesting MozzaRisella sprouted rice based soft dairy free cheese, which made an excellent addition to a recent caprese salad. They have prepared foods, and frozen items available to take home (such as varieties of vegan stuffed ravioli.)

They have a great warm inviting atmosphere, and it's a cozy (i.e., kind of a small space). While there is room for about three people to sit in the window area, prepare to either stand and eat, or take a box home (or eat there, AND take a box of treats home like I did...)

The people working there are friendly and helpful, and when I walked in, all wide-eyed and overwhelmed with options, they gave me a run down of what they had and offered some recommendations. Bunner's was just all around fantastic from the start. And then... I ate one of the ""gypsy"" cookies, and I was completely sold. Oats, melty chocolate chips, dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie. I want to go back, right now, and get another one.

I should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross, and I have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease. So what I'm saying when I say this place is good, is that it's not just gluten-free good. It's actually good.

When I went in today there were cupcakes (three different kinds: vanilla, chocolate and red velvet), DONUTS, amazingly yummy cookies (gypsy cookie), freshly baked loaves of bread (which I'm kicking myself for not trying), muffins, and cookie sandwiches!

What I'm going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan (and/or gluten free) treats.

Now, you'll see it in a sweet location in the Annex.

Full disclosure: I've been excited about this bakery opening for months, and I don't care who knows it. I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)

I had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.

Then I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.

The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.

In the fridge & freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.

I like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make & bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.

Service was friendly and fast & they take cash, credit, and debit.

This location is clean, and at 4pm, completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there. They had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening (which is now over) but honored my request anyway. Free soda is always a plus. 

Pizza was decent. One half of the GIANT slice was perfect, the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil. Crispy tasty crust, maybe verging on too crispy, but it was still within tolerance levels. Also, I'm happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available, which is more than I can say for half of the downtown locations I've been to after 7pm. 

I'd come here again and I hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty (vegan or otherwise) food options.","['no more trudging downtown to get a oily slice of potato rosemary (the fredo) pizza for me, finally, a new pizzaiolo up north and in my neighbourhood.', 'this location is clean, and at 4pm, completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there.', 'they had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening (which is now over) but honored my request anyway.', 'free soda is always a plus.', 'pizza was decent.', 'one half of the giant slice was perfect, the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil.', 'crispy tasty crust, maybe verging on too crispy, but it was still within tolerance levels.', ""also, i'm happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available, which is more than i can say for half of the downtown locations i've been to after 7pm."", ""i'd come here again and i hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty (vegan or otherwise) food options.""]",9,10
835,Totum Life Science,"I've been going to Totum for almost a year now I think, and it's been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks. Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.

I still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I'm just too much of a night owl. I'm also lazy.

Classes to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.

There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.

One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.

It's clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I'd totally recommend you try it out. But only if you're awesome.

Worst/best thing - it's right next to Soma Chocolate.","[""i've been going to totum for almost a year now i think, and it's been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks."", 'everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.', ""i still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends."", ""there is a free week trial, and i'd totally recommend you try it out."", ""but only if you're awesome."", ""worst/best thing - it's right next to soma chocolate.""]",17,21

We ordered one order of the vegetarian combination plate, and between the two of us, we still didn't finish all of it.

My barista was friendly, and helped me out right away, so that part was nice.

I know some people aren't into the ""butter flavoured topping"" that AMC has going on, but I love that it's available. Not that it's in anyway good for you (mmm soybean oil...), just that all signs point to its veganness, which works for me.

839,Freshii,"I didn't mean to go to Freshii for lunch the other day, but events conspired in such a way that I was in the neighbourhood (hoping to buy a Indie Coffee Pass from Crema Coffee - but they were sold out) and the line was short (because their debit was down) and my stomach decided it was time to eat.

After looking at the menu board, I filled out the custom order form (and there were LOTS of options to choose from.) s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasn't working. (right at noon time! what terrible timing!)

I got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.

If you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of ""Chef Creations"" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).

The other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...

Just a note, I can never get the freshii wifi to work with my iPod Touch, but I can connect to it with my netbook.

Dr Adams is very professional and thorough. She was interested in my home life and even what I was reading in the office! We discussed many options of treatment for my 3 reasons of being in the office. She gave me immediate referrals and advice that I felt was not only professional but thoughtful in her answers. She even called for my bloodwork and labs right there in the office instead of sending me on a goose chase to a random lab.

I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut. 
Leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like.

867,Scottsdale Cottonwoods Resort & Suites,"I booked this hotel in a rush and my bad as I did not read the $18/night resort fee. Basically I paid $66/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.

The resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).

The room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.

The man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.

They also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.

I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about. There are a lot of other places in Scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money.

Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum! 

Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks.

No water at the end of your massage like other places. She disappeared after the massage never to be seen again...lol.
The check out was interesting. There was a pimple faced teen ago boy at the desk that was not sure exactly what to say. I figured a business like this will have a receptionist all the time and not an awkward boy at the check out not knowing what to say to customers.

890,Imbibe Tours,"My wife and I took the tour with Imbibe Tours a few days after Christmas. We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit ""homey"". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine.

893,Skye Bistro,"My wife and I had an early dinner here on a Monday. The staff was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that the other waiter was much more interested in customer service than our waitress. Our waitress read off some specials, but we overheard the other waiter reading off a much more extensive list and go out of his way to make his diners much more comfortable.

The food was OK, but overpriced for what we received. I would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas. The risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees; however, it is a bit dense (Gordon Ramsey would not approve). It is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work, but I think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd. At present, it is a ""blue hair"" establishment. This may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract, but the image discourages those under 40 from dining here.

I would also look to update the wine list. At present they have a wide range, but these are the very traditional and well-known mega-winery names.

894,Giada,"This stop is a gem on the strip. Situated on the second floor of the Cromwell hotel across Las Vegas Blvd from Caesar's Palace, The view is excellent. Depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. We were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brought our own bottle of wine. The corking fee was a bit high (but not for Vegas prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. Once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. We highly recommend the baked pasta of the day, the Buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), Baby Sweet Peppers and Marinated Olives. Our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. We were so fulfilled by the time we left. In the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. This may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot, but we weren't complaining :) 

I would highly recommend Giada's for lunch!

So I ordered an entree and asked what they had on draft.  Apparently that wasn't specific enough, because my beers were $5 a pop.  The waitress played dumb, and when I spoke to a manager he treated me like an idiot for not asking for the ""draft specials"" rather than the drafts.  That language is nowhere on the menu.

The service is a little slow, usually, but I honestly don't care.  The food is amazing, and the beer...  oh, the beer.  I love the Sunbru for warmer days, and the Oatmeal Stout when its chillier out.  I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious, and that leads to me splurging on appetizers.  My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip.  

All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.

900,Bangkok Thai Bar-B-Q,"Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. 

My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.

I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment. 

For a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal.","['me and a friend ordered delivery through grubhub, which was fine.', 'the bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.', '(i recently paid $65 for chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)', ""i'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment."", 'for a $50 delivery order, i was extremely disappointed.', ""worst $50 i've ever spent on a meal.""]",28,150

902,Thai Buffet & American Sandwiches,"Oh, what a wonderful experience.  

My boyfriend and I were going a little nuts on Groupon yesterday (I think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a Groupon Now! for Thai Buffet.  My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.

We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.

My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than ""restaurant-y,"" for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.

As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.

Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.","['oh, what a wonderful experience.', 'my boyfriend and i were going a little nuts on groupon yesterday (i think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a groupon now!', 'for thai buffet.', ""i'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though."", 'definitely will be back.', 'you get a great value for the price (even without a groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.']",18,92

I was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with BBQ sauce instead of Katsu sauce.  It just didn't taste quite right.  The lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either.  I'll just go to Ono next time I hear the call of Katsu.","[""today was my second or third time coming to paradise, but i wouldn't call it that if i had a choice."", 'i ordered the chicken katsu, which is a favorite of mine when it comes to hawaiian food.', 'i was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with bbq sauce instead of katsu sauce.', ""it just didn't taste quite right."", ""the lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either."", ""i'll just go to ono next time i hear the call of katsu.""]",6,187

Also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  I don't eat burgers really, so I can't speak to those.  I am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.

I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.  I am in love with their sandwiches, and although I used to devoutly order Polish sausages & fries, I can't turn my back on my new love.  Not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try.","['best.', 'french fries.', 'ever.', ""also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  i don't eat burgers really, so i can't speak to those."", 'i am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.', 'that is never the case at chicago hamburger co.  this might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color i have ever seen.', ""it's because they put relish in it."", 'lots of delicious relish.', ""i am in love with their sandwiches, and although i used to devoutly order polish sausages & fries, i can't turn my back on my new love."", ""not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try.""]",12,368

913,Omni William Penn Hotel,"I was here for a conference in April, and this was probably the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in. The staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory. Wi-Fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.

The main issue I had was with the room I stayed in the first night. It faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light. I also couldn't leave the curtains open if I wanted privacy. The worst part was the noise. There was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room. The noise wasn't incredibly loud, but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep. 

The next day, I asked for a new room. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance. I got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light. I just wish this was true for all the rooms.

Overall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room.","[""i was here for a conference in april, and this was probably the most beautiful hotel i've stayed in."", 'the staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory.', 'wi-fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.', 'the main issue i had was with the room i stayed in the first night.', ""it faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light."", 'the next day, i asked for a new room.', 'the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance.', 'i got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light.', 'i just wish this was true for all the rooms.', 'overall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room.']",14,263

They weren't nice to the staff, the staff thus wasn't nice to us. 

However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful. We enjoyed a bottle of wine during our three hour wait (and therefore were not drunk as one reviewer suggests) and excellent conversation. The ambiance is wonderful. The staff was very friendly since we were friendly to them. We were not rushed to eat quickly, although the pizza is so good it is hard not to shovel it in your mouth! Overall, we were quite pleased and look forward to going again. 

I'm not sure how one reviewer said it cost her $70 for her meal. Pizza's are $10 to $12, I'm sure soda isn't all that expensive, and salads range from $6-9. Must have left a pretty good tip! 

We've had the Biancoverde and Rosa, as well as the Spiedini for an appetizer. Delish. I just love this place and wish I could go more often.

What's so great about the blended drinks at Toshi's is that they *shock* actually blend all the ice!! At the ""S"" place, I usually have chunks of ice at the bottom which greatly annoys me. Not so at Toshi's! And they always toast the bagels, which is great. They have limited outdoor seating, and they don't mind if you bring your well-behaved dogs.

As others have said, the tomato soup is quite delicious. I'm also a big fan of the salad with cranberries....but the name escapes me right now. The turkey wrap is average...lacking flavor. The breakfast quiche is also average. I think mine had been sitting out for a while, so maybe a fresh one would taste better? Cookies are good, but it is hard to screw up cookies. 

The salads are gigantic. Seriously, who needs a salad that big? I guess if you want it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, what a deal! 

It can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines, but you figure out that one is for the bakery, one is for the rest of the food, cafeteria style.

Why do I like Wildflower better? I think their sandwiches are better, and the soup as well. The only soup I like at Paradise is the tomato soup. The others are lacking. I need flavor!

First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children. 

The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though! 

We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading. 

I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average. 

Now all that being said.....our bill was very cheap ($33) and that included two beers, wings, and two entrees.

Speaking of wine, don't be scared when you see the wine list...I didn't see any wines by the glass, only bottles, so I simply told the server what I wanted, and there it was! 

I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.

The second best part of our night (the food was first, of course) was meeting Mark Tarbell! I tried not to act like a fool, but I watched him on Iron Chef, so it was cool to meet him!

Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM!

936,Tokyo Lobby Sushi and Grill,"We've been to Tokoyo lobby twice. Both times were great. I'll start by saying I gave it four stars instead of five because it is small, small, small inside and the ambiance isn't fantastic. But the things you must do for good sushi! 

I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory.

937,Vogue Bistro,"Vogue Bistro is by far the best restaurant in Surprise! Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...

1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef. 

2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. 

3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.

4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...

5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.

6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. 

Ok, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. 

1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. 

2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. 

So there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!).","['vogue bistro is by far the best restaurant in surprise!', 'why, you ask?', 'oh so many reasons!', 'the best restaurant in surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in surprise.', 'it is more scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you scottsdale folk!', ').']",46,388
938,PetSmart,"Ok, normally I like to support local over big chains, but I've always had a good experience at this PetSmart. The cashiers are always friendly, the store is clean, and most of the time I can find what I need (minus one time they were out of vitamins). I wish they had more organic and natural products, but since I feed my dogs mostly fresh food, this isn't an issue. They have a great selection of holiday items, so I am looking forward to what they have this year! And I've had no problem returning items if I needed to.

The cheese is cheaper than what you will find at other grocery stores...we did a price comparison. I know when I shop at Sprouts I am not getting overly processed, full of preservatives. I am getting fresh food!! What a concept, huh? And the bulk section is fantastic. I love being able to buy spices and flour and anything else you can think of (especially the chocolate covered toffees!!) in just the amount I need.

940,Tomo Japanese Cuisine,"I went to Tomo with a very large group (around 18 folks, we had a reservation). Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.","['i went to tomo with a very large group (around 18 folks, we had a reservation).', ""things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks!"", 'after we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?)', 'now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening!', 'nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough.', ""bottom line: don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.""]",28,359

After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say ""that's not almond"" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says ""hurry up"" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies ""oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though"" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous.","['absolute worst nail salon experience of my life, i will never go back.', 'i urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as i got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn\'t clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt ""oops"" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut.', ""next i told her i wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as i'm watching her file my nails i have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval."", 'after phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that i wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say ""that\'s not almond"" uh yes it is.', 'as she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch!', 'yet again i ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally i pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them.', 'once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!)', ""i almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but i just wanted to get the hell out of there so i settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place i go) this whole time i was perfectly polite and externally calm i even tipped her a little bit because as a server i know what it's like to rely on tips."", ""i only went because this place had such good yelp reviews, so i feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails i know when things aren't right."", 'as a bonus not even two weeks later i had a nail break off, ridiculous.']",14,17

This was my first visit to APDC and the place was just buzzing with energy and the sweet smell of pork. Order the bison tongue as an appy and it was outstanding.  My friend had the seared foie gras and he kept rolling his eyes in delight. The bottle of wine was a beautiful Cote du  Rhone Quartz which paried very well with the meal.  For main, I had the maple pig's foot.  The presentation is shocking... the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings.  The taste was insane.  Skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory.  The mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish. Very indulgent.  Brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to Vancouver.  Split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed.  Gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing.  Verdict:  These cans do travel so long as you keep them cold.  They are good for at least 3 days.
