Inspired by Taboada et al. (2011)[6] and Hu and Liu (2004)[3], we present the Unsupervised Lexicon-Based
Sentiment Topic Model (ULSTM) using a self-established sentiment lexicon. The current application of the model
mainly concerns with reviews from the Yelp Open Dataset, which contains almost 6-million customer reviews. The
model assigns each review a corresponding sentiment score based on its semantic meaning and syntactic structure.
Then, it applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) (LDA)[2] to selected businesses, aiming to extract global
topics as highlights and/or opportunities for improvement of the restaurants.
