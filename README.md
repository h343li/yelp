In this package, we assume input reviews for clustering and prediction are made of normal texts.

Some useful terminal/git commands:
git add -A: stages all files in the folder. 
git add filename: stages filename
git commit -m message: commits files in the folder
git push origin master: pushes commited files
git pull origin master: pulls changes
git rm -r --cached filename: ignore previous commit
git status: current status
git log --oneline: check git history
NOTE: it does not matter that the file is not in your current checked version 
it's in the project history and will always be attempted to be pushed
git reset --hard commitID: changes current commit to commitID and removes all 
attempted commits after commitID.

vim filename: opens editor
shift + i: inserts inside vim
esc: exits insert
: + x: saves changes
touch filename: creates the file
