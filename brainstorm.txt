Assumption 1: when a word with a neutral tag encounters an intensifier, we assume
its sentiment will become negative. e.g. "fat" -> "too fat". This assumption is
rather reasonable because we would not expect combinations such as "too expected"

Assumption 2: synonym of an intensifier is also an intensifier

Assumption 3: we assume a word cannot be both negative or positive. If a word
belongs to both classes, we assume it's an ambiguity from the reviewer and remove
these words
